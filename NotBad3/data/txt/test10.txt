hi, my name is Ibrahim. I'm 21, a student of Computer and Information Systems at Ain Shams University.

I have been gay for 10 years, I think. When I was in grade 6 in primary school, my teacher had a new baby, so my class had to separate into another class, and my friends were not with me in my new class.

Because my mother is a teacher in this school and in this class, they were losers in lessons, they said they would punish me because of what my mother had done with them before in the past. So, I became very lonely. Not just that, they wouldn't let me talk to any girl in my class or another class. And so, my friends who were in my old class, I had no contact with them after this separation issue.

Besides, I was in a painful and dangerous situation with new people in the new class. There was a sexual danger too. One of the students told me that if I sat in this pantalon, he would let me play football with them, and so on. I agreed, but I figured out he was lying to me.

While this happened, my mother and father were not free at all. They finished their work, and Mom came to make food, and Dad came to eat food, and we all slept to the circle of the days. And my siblings were not close to me to say something like that.

Meanwhile, my cousin was close to me, but he lived in the countryside far away from me. I always told Mom to go there, to play with him, and don't feel lonely again.

After the bullying of this student in the new class, I felt like I wanted to be friends with anyone. I wanted so badly to be close to any friend.

This cousin and I were able to take a shower together, and this was allowed because we were younge to do anything bad. But this cousin was older than me by 2 years and was considered a new teenager. He wanted to try new things, so he asked me to do something, but in my mind, it was not usual to do this thing. But I had to do what he wanted to save our friendship, and I feared losing him too. This means he tried to do sexual things with me, but normally he couldn't, but I loved being with someone who was close to me like that.

When I went back to my home, I became lonely again. So, I sometimes took my phone and went to my uncle's home, who had an internet connection. I went there and stood in the street below this home, just to connect and search for the word "friends" to get two friends with love between each other and have the same hobby and so on.

Next, I saw the "best friends" statement. I didn't know its meaning, but the video results could make me feel better while these friends were much closer than before. And then I saw "gay friends," and I was not aware of its meaning too, but I loved it more because it was like where I was with my cousin. This made me feel safe.

So, I decided to go search only for this word in YouTube. Until I found an app to make friends from it. I installed it and got to know one older than me by 5 years. He told me that he would become a father, brother, and friend for me, and sure I agreed.

Like you might think, he took everything he wanted from a lonely boy who had no idea how people do shitty things to manipulate them and get from them all things and go, just go.

After this first time, I decided to love girls. I went to the church and made a lot of friends, boys and girls, but I felt the same in my new class but in a complicated and indirect way, so I couldn't love girls.

But with time, I was in stressed situations that made me need to feel not lonely, even if I had boys as friends, but all of them were just friends when girls came.

I installed the app again and met another one, and the same thing happened before.

But one of them I met wanted to do something I was not told i can do, and he wanted it so badly, and I refused. So, he got a knife out of his pantalon and threatened me that he would kill me. So, I cried badly to let me go home and don't do this with me if i dont let him do what he want.

Another situation was with a friend I trusted, and I went to his house, and he was not gay at all. He wanted to steal my phone in a cool way, and he wanted to exchange our phones while his phone was stolen from another gay too. And he made me cry to go home after that. I went home with my phone after a long cry.

Another situation, I wanted to make close or best friends that I could tell him everything about my feelings to boys and so on. Meanwhile, I found a good and smart-looking guy, and I did what he wanted in sex, but he loved to watch straight sex on his phone while he did it with me. After a few minutes, I figured that he was recording me.

And he put me in stress for months for this thing he had until he forgot (I think).

When the last situation happened, I searched for how to get out of this open jail, but I was too young to go with this process and write things and so on.

Next situation, after a long journey of being gay in Egypt and how much uncertainty I received from being gay with another who manipulated my feelings and emotions, came the most smart one, who took all the bad things I told him, like what I had passed, and it was so bad. He took all of this and made them into one package and treated me like a slave to him. And I was not happy for that, but I said to myself, give him a chance, he might change with time, until I figured he didn't love me. And loved girls more than boys, and did sex with boys only to treat them in a harmful way only.

And today (2024/08/06), I made a new friend from the app, that I sought to be only my friend and not do any sexual things, and I asked him to go play some bilardo or something on PlayStation for guys.

After we finished, while we walked around, two older guys stopped me and him and tried to talk to the people that I took 2000 EG pounds from the app (stole from him) and said that this guy (me) is gay and gets fucked from men and so on. The people believed him, sure, whatever my words were, because being gay is just bad, so it can do anything bad in the world (this is the point of view of the people here in Egypt).

The other one took my phone and went, and the first one gave boxes and slapped me on my face and raised his knife on me to let his shirt from my hand go. And people went and didn't even listen to my point of view. And believing him is the base, just he faked an app chat with what can make people believe him fast.

And all people, old and young, looked at me as pitch and how can make everything bad, not just steal some money.

After I got his area with some good friends who could deal with these things, I figured out that these things were done with a lot of young men like me, making a trap for one in the app and fake a chat that benefits from it in front of people. And to make people agree with his boxes and some harmful things to my body and his knife too, he told them this is gay and gets fucked. And easily, they let him hurt me even with his hands or his knife.

All of that to give 2000 EG pounds to them.

Until now, my phone is with them, and I can't get it back. I'm afraid to go to the police station to tell them because if I told the police I'm gay, they will take me to a smaller jail than I live now in it, the real one. If I told the police I was just stolen from, after what the police will do with these bad guys, those bad guys will get to my place and revenge for this, and I can't control their reactions. I'm in a local bad area in Egypt where bad things like fighting with knives and kicking people are much more than any area in Egypt.

This happened at 12:30 AM, and now it's 07:36 AM, and I want to kill myself.

Tell me why!

All people know about me, that I'm gay. Old one and young one in the street will know from them when they go out of the home.

All of my dreams and passion for the graduation project of the last year in my college are gone.

I can't move on from this. I'm now nothing at all. I notice that young ones in the street look at me as a smelly bad thing.

How do you ask me to dream and put my efforts into things in this environment like that?
