The Script of Persia 
Romanization of Persian represents Persian language with Latin script. Several schemes exist, each with own rules and goals. Transliteration mirrors spelling and orthography, while transcription mirrors pronunciation and phonology. 
This process is essential for facilitating communication across languages, as it enables non-Persian speakers to read and write Persian words accurately. 
The transliteration method is commonly used in language learning materials, dictionaries, and online resources, whereas transcription is often employed in linguistic research and language documentation. 
In addition, the choice of scheme depends on the purpose of the text, with some schemes prioritizing consistency and others focusing on phonetic accuracy. 
Notably, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established standards for romanizing Persian, providing a standardized framework for transliteration and transcription.
