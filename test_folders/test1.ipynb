Persian حسن صباح romanizedḤāsāne Śaḇaḥ c 1050 12 June 1124 also known as Hasan I of Alamut was a religious and military leader founder of the Nizari Ismaili sect widely known as the Hashshashin or the Order of Assassins as well as the Nizari Ismaili state ruling from 1090 to 1124 AD234 Alongside his role as a formidable leader Sabbah was an accomplished scholar of mathematics most notably in geometry as well as astronomy and philosophy especially in epistemology56 He and each of the later Assassin leaders came to be known in the West as the Old Man of the Mountain a name given to the sects leader in the writings of Marco Polo that referenced the sects possession of the commanding mountain fortress of Alamut Castle78 Sourcesedit Hasan is thought to have written an autobiography which did not survive but seems to underlie the first part of an anonymous Ismaili biography entitled Sargozashte Seyyednā Persian سرگذشت سیدنا The latter is known only from quotations made by later Persian authors9 Hasan also wrote a treatise in Persian on the doctrine of talīm called alFusul alarbaa10 The text is no longer in existence but fragments are cited or paraphrased by alShahrastānī and several Persian historians10 Early life and conversionedit Qom and Rayyedit Engraving of Hasani Sabbah riding a horse The possibly autobiographical information found in Sargozashti Seyyednā is the main source for Hasans background and early life According to this Hasani Sabbāh was born in the city of Qom Persia in the 1050s to a family of Twelver Shia9 His father a Kufan Arab reportedly of Yemenite origins had left the Sawād of Kufa located in modern Iraq to settle in the town of Qom1112 one of the first centres of Arab settlement in Persia and a stronghold of Twelver Shia13 Early in his life his family moved to Rayy9 Rayy was a city that had a history of radical Islamic thought since the 9th century with Hamdan Qarmaṭ as one of its teachers It was in this religious centre that Hasan developed a keen interest in metaphysical matters and adhered to the Twelver code of instruction During the day6 he studied at home and mastered palmistry languages philosophy astronomy and mathematics especially geometry5 Rayy was also the home of Ismaili missionaries in the Jibal At the time Ismailism was a growing movement in Persia and other lands east of Egypt14 The Persian Ismailis supported the dawa mission directed by the Fatimid caliphate of Cairo and recognized the authority of the ImamCaliph alMustansir d 1094 though Isfahan rather than Cairo may have functioned as their principal headquarters14 The Ismāīlī mission worked on three layers the lowest was the fidai or foot soldier followed by the rafīk or comrade and finally the dāī or missionary It has been suggested that the popularity of the Ismāīlī religion in Persia was due to the peoples dissatisfaction with the Seljuk rulers who had recently removed local rulers9 Conversion to Ismailism and training in Cairoedit At the age of 17 Hasan converted and swore allegiance to the Fatimid caliph in Cairo Hasans studies did not end with his crossing over He further studied under two other dāiyyayn and as he proceeded on his path he was looked upon with eyes of respect3 Hasans austere and devoted commitment to the dawa brought him in audience with the chief missionary of the region Abdu lMalik ibn Attash Ibn Attash suitably impressed with the young seventeenyearold Hasan made him Deputy Missionary and advised him to go to Cairo to further his studiescitation needed However Hasan did not initially travel to Cairo Some historians have postulated that Hasan following his conversion was playing host to some members of the Fatimid caliphate and this was leaked to the antiFatimid and antiShīa vizier Nizam alMulk This prompted his abandoning Rayy and heading to Cairo in 1076citation needed Hasan took about 2 years to reach Cairo Along the way he toured many other regions that did not fall in the general direction of Egyptcitation needed Isfahan was the first city that he visited He was hosted by one of the Missionaries of his youth a man who had taught the youthful Hasan in Rayy His name was Resi Abufasl and he further instructed Hasancitation needed From here he went to Arran current Azerbaijan hundreds of miles to the north and from there through Armenia Here he attracted the ire of priests following a heated discussion and Hasan was thrown out of the town he was in He then turned south and traveled through Iraq reached Damascus in Syria He left for Egypt from Palestine Records exist some in the fragmentary remains of his autobiography and from another biography written by RashidalDin Hamadani in 1310 to date his arrival in Egypt at 30 August 1078 It is unclear how long Hasan stayed in Egypt about 3 years is the usually accepted amount of time He continued his studies here and became a full missionary Return to Persiaedit Whilst he was in Cairo studying and preaching he incurred the displeasure of the Chief of the Army Badr alJamalī1 This may have been a result of the fact that Hasan supported Nizar the Ismaili ImamCaliph alMustanṣirs elder son as the next Imam Hasan was briefly imprisoned by Badr alJamali The collapse of a minaret of the jail was taken to be an omen in favor of Hasan and he was promptly released and deportedcitation needed The ship that he was traveling on was wrecked He was rescued and taken to Syria Traveling via Aleppo and Baghdad he terminated his journey at Isfahan in 1081 Hasans life now was totally devoted to the mission Hasan toured extensively throughout Persia In northern Persia touching the south shore of the Caspian Sea are the mountains of Alborzcitation needed These mountains were home to a people who had traditionally resisted attempts by both Arabs and Turkish subjugation this place was also a home of Shia leaning The news of this Ismāīlīs activities reached Nizam alMulk who dispatched his soldiers with the orders for Hasans capture Hasan evaded them and went deeper into the mountainscitation needed Capture of Alamutedit Further information NizariSeljuk wars The Hashshashins fortress of Alamut Castle His search for a base from which to guide his mission ended when in 1088 he found the castle of Alamut in the Rudbar area modern Qazvin Irancitation needed It was a fort that stood guard over a valley that was about fifty kilometers long and five kilometers widecitation needed This fortress had been built about the year 865 legend has it that it was built by a king who saw his eagle fly up to and perch upon a rock a propitious omen the importance of which this king Wah Sudan ibn Marzuban understood Likening the perching of the eagle to a lesson given by it he called the fort Aluh Amukht the Eagles Teaching15 Hasans takeover of the fort was conducted without any significant bloodshed To effect this transition Hasan employed a patient and deliberate strategy one which took the better part of two years to effect First Hasan sent his Daʻiyyīn and Rafīks to win over the villages in the valley and their inhabitants Next key people amongst this populace were converted and finally in 1090 Hasan took over the fort by infiltrating it with his converts16 Hasan gave the former owner a draft drawn on the name of a wealthy landlord and told him to obtain the promised money from this man when the landlord saw the draft with Hasans signature he immediately paid the amount to the forts owner astonishing himcitation needed Another probably apocryphal version of the takeover states that Hasan offered 3000 gold dinars to the forts owner for the amount of land that would fit a buffalos hide The terms having been agreed upon Hasan cut the hide into strips and linked them into a large ring around the perimeter of the fort whose owner was thus undone by his own greedcitation needed While legend holds that after capturing Alamut Hasan thereafter devoted himself so faithfully to study that in the nearly 35 years he was there he never left his quarters excepting only two times when he went up to the roofcitation needed this reported isolation is highly doubtful given his extensive recruiting and organizational involvement in the growing Ismāīlī insurrections in Persia and Syria17 Nonetheless Hasan was highly educated and was known for austerity studying translating praying fasting and directing the activities of the Daʻwa the propagation of the Nizarī doctrine was headquartered at Alamut He knew the Qurān by heart could quote extensively from the texts of most Muslim sects and apart from philosophy was well versed in mathematics astronomy alchemy medicine architecture and the major scientific disciplines of his timecitation needed In a major departure from tradition Hasan declared Persian to be the language of holy literature for Nizaris a decision that resulted in all the Nizari Ismāīlī literature from Persia Syria Afghanistan and Central Asia to be transcribed in Persian for several centuries15 Foreign views Marco Polo and Chinaedit Hasani Sabbah as depicted in Livre des merveilles The leaders of Nizari Ismailis in Persia were designated by Marco Polo using a Syrian equivalent term known in Europe at that time18 as Elder or Old Man of the Mountain Polos travelogue ca 1300 describes the Old Man of the Mountain as a charlatan who devised plots to convert young men to his sect At the court of the Old Man of the Mountain they were educated in various languages and customs courtly etiquette and trained in martial and other skills7 At Alamut they had impressive libraries whose collections included books on various religious traditions philosophical and scientific texts and scientific equipment19 Xishiji Chinese 西使記 a Chinese manuscript completed in 1263 relates a story similar to that of Polo The sect leaders ordered to send assassins to hide in those kingdoms which did not surrender They stabbed their lords and women as well and they died20 Nizari doctrineedit Historians and scholars identify Hasani Sabbah as the founder of the Nizari Assassins and their doctrine It developed during the struggle for succession of Nizar to the Fatimid throne in Cairo that eventually laid the foundation of the Nizari Ismailism Shia Islam Since then as a basic element of conservative nature the Ismaili Imamate includes a hidden imam in addition to the visible or hazar meaning apparent21 imam of the time acting as such in a community An important task of the latter is the proliferation of the doctrine and of the undisclosed imams spiritual guidance in learning centers having instructors proficient in teaching techniques Devotion of the true believers having absolute faith22 in the beliefs is another element originating from the times of Sabbah in Northern Iran23 who reportedly was so devout that he even had one of his sons executed after he was accused of drunkenness24 A Nizari assassin is identified as fidai or devotee who offers his life for others or in the service of a particular cause25 Personal lifeedit Hasan is known for his ascetic and austere religious lifestyle At his modest living quarters in the Alamut Castle he spent most of his time reading writing and administration During his 45 years of residence in Alamut he apparently left his quarters only twice to ascend the rooftop26 Hasani Sabbah probably had one wife two daughters and two sons2726 Hasans wife and daughters were sent to Gerdkuh as a safe place during Shirgirs campaign against Alamut they never returned They lived on spinning26 He had both his sons executed Muhammad for khamr and Ustad Husayn for his suspected role in the murder of dai Husayn Qaini26 Hassan was highly revered by the Nizari community whose members called him Sayyidna Our Master and regularly visited his mausoleum in Rudbar before it was demolished by the Mongols26 In popular cultureedit Betty Bouthoul published a popular book in French titled Le grand maître des assassins Master of the Assassins about Hasani Sabbāh in 193628 A 1938 novel named Alamut by Vladimir Bartol is based on Hasans rise to power2930 The British space rock group Hawkwind recorded a song called Hassan I Sahba on its 1977 album Quark Strangeness and Charm31 This song was also recorded by the Brain Surgeons on their album Malpractise 32 Hasani Sabbāh is mentioned often by his moniker The Old Man of the Mountain in many of William S Burroughss novels including Nova Express Cities of the Red Night The Place of Dead Roads and The Western Lands According to Barry Miles book The Beat Hotel Burroughs was introduced to Hasan through Betty Bouthouls book while staying in Paris France33 The full story of Burroughs interest in Hassan Sabbah was told in the 2023 book Two Assassins by Oliver Harris and Farid Ghadami34 He is portrayed in the Turkish TV series Uyanış Büyük Selçuklu by Gürkan Uygun35 He is portrayed in the Egyptian TV series ElHashashin by Karim Abdel
