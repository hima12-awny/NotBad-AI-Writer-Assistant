To begin, gather all necessary ingredients and equipment. Start by preheating the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. While the oven is heating, mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl, ensuring they are well combined. Next, in a separate bowl, whisk together the wet ingredients until smooth. Slowly incorporate the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, stirring continuously until a homogeneous batter forms. Once the batter is ready, pour it into a greased baking pan, spreading it evenly. Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove the pan from the oven and allow the baked goods to cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes before serving. Finally, slice and enjoy your freshly baked treat with your preferred accompaniment.

للبدء ، جمع جميع المكونات والمعدات اللازمة.ابدأ بتسخين الفرن إلى 350 درجة فهرنهايت.أثناء تسخين الفرن ، اخلطي المكونات الجافة في وعاء كبير ، مما يضمن الجمع بينها.بعد ذلك ، في وعاء منفصل ، اخفق المكونات الرطبة معًا حتى تصبح ناعمة.قم بدمج الخليط الرطب ببطء في المكونات الجافة ، مع التحريك بشكل مستمر حتى يتشكل الخليط المتجانس.بمجرد أن يصبح الخليط جاهزًا ، صبه في مقلاة مشهور ، ونشره بالتساوي.ضع المقلاة في الفرن المسبق مسخنًا واخبزه لمدة 25-30 دقيقة أو حتى يخرج مسواك المسواك في الوسط.أخرج المقلاة من الفرن واترك البضائع المخبوزة تبرد على رف سلك لمدة 15 دقيقة على الأقل قبل التقديم.أخيرًا ، شريحة واستمتع بعلوتك الطازجة مع مرافقتك المفضلة.

summary:
Preheat oven to 350°F. Mix dry ingredients, then whisk wet ingredients. Combine, stirring until smooth. Pour into greased pan and bake 25-30 minutes. Let cool, then slice and serve. 

Rephrase in Technical tone:
Initiate the preparation process by assembling all requisite ingredients and equipment. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit to establish a thermally stable environment. Concurrently, combine the dry ingredients in a large receptacle, ensuring thorough integration. In a separate container, agitate the wet ingredients until a smooth consistency is achieved. Gradually introduce the wet mixture into the dry ingredients, maintaining continuous agitation until a homogeneous batter is formed. Upon achieving the desired batter consistency, transfer it to a lubricated baking vessel, distributing it uniformly. Place the vessel in the preheated oven and subjected it to thermal energy for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center emerges uncontaminated. Remove the vessel from the oven and permit the baked goods to thermally stabilize on a wire rack for a minimum of 15 minutes prior to consumption. Finally, segment and serve the freshly baked product with your preferred accompaniment.
