Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around objects and data, rather than actions and logic. In OOP, objects encapsulate data and behavior, interacting through defined interfaces. Encapsulation ensures data security and modularity, allowing objects to be easily reused and maintained. Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, fostering code reuse and hierarchical relationships. Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, facilitating flexibility and extensibility. Abstraction hides complex implementation details, focusing on essential behaviors. Together, these principles enhance code organization, scalability, and maintainability.
